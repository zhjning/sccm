Description: We propose a novel model based on a causal mediation framework to analyze functional regulatory relationships among three cells. 
    This model evaluates whether Cell A can regulate the specific functions of Cell C through an intermediate Cell B. Existing tools typically rely on the expression of ligand-receptor genes within cell subgroups, which does not adequately reflect whether the specific function of a target cell might be influenced by another cell type and an intermediate cell. Our tool utilizes intercellular interactions measured by commonly used intercellular functional interaction tools to assess whether a cellâ€™s specific function is related to a third-party cell, allowing users to switch between different methods for measuring causal relationships to assess the stability of the results.
